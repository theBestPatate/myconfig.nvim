# A fork of kickstart.nvim tailored for data-scientist and NixOs afficionados

Hi ! This is my fork of the amazing kickstart.nvim project.
If you don't have a neovim config yet, you should definitely make your own fork and play with it.
This repo is mainly for me and the people who use Python and R daily ?( May be
Nixos too ) that I managed to convince to try nvim.

You may find interesting stuff regardless in my config files. Happy hacking !
